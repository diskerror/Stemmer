# Stemmer
Realization of Porter Stemmer 2 using primarily regular expressions. This is a personal exercise in C++ programming and building PHP extensions. There is also a simple command line version.

Sample text files are from [a]http://snowball.tartarus.org[/a].

Command line make file has been tested on Debian 8 and OSX 10.10.

# MultiTokenizer
This is used with the Stemmer PHP extension. It's a simple text tokenizer that allows for multiple characters to be used as a delimiter.
